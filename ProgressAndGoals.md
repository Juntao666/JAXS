# Goals to be Achieved

All frontend components including:
- A masthead page
- An about page
- A submissions guidelines page
- A account creation page
- A manuscript submission page that will lead to the account creation page and log in page if not logged in
- A log in page
- A personal home page that includes the ability to edit/delete accounts and will lead to peronal manuscript dashboards that will display appropriate manuscripts and allow editing of those manuscripts
- Editor specific pages including text editing page, permission control page, and a list of people
- manuscript submisson page

These pages will satisfy all the front ed requirements stated in the requirements documentation here: https://github.com/gcallah/SoftwareEngineering/blob/master/docs/user_reqs_spring_2025.md

The current plan is to dedicate different pages to different people, to allow for simultaneous work to be done on the project. Related pages, for example, log in and account creation page, will be assigned to the same person for convinience.
